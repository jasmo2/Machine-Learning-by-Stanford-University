function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
    %COMPUTECENTROIDS returns the new centroids by computing the means of the 
    %data points assigned to each centroid.
    %   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
    %   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
    %   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
    %   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
    %   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
    %   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
    %   assigned to it.
    %

    % Useful variables
    [m n] = size(X);

    % You need to return the following variables correctly.
    centroids = zeros(K, n);


    % ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    % Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
    %               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
    %               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
    %               centroid i.
    %
    % Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
    %

    % 1ยบ I need to know which point-values depends on each 'idx'
    for k=1:K
        index = find(idx == k)
        % get the denomitator, how many times the index repeats
        index_length = length(index);

        summatory = sum(X(index,:));
        centroids(k,:) = summatory / index_length;
    end
    % =============================================================
    centroids;
